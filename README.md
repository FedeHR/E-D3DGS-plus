Official repository for <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03613">"Per-Gaussian Embedding-Based Deformation for Deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting"</a><br>

- Some contents of the paper are updated after the camera-ready. 
- Code will be updated by the end of July. However, it may be slightly delayed because we are organizing the code along with other studies simultaneously.
- Thanks for your interest. Please stay tuned.
